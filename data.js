<p>An ocean is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.
On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean.
These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic),
and Arctic Oceans. The word "ocean" is often used interchangeably with "sea" in American English.
Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly 
or fully enclosed by land,[5] though "the sea" refers also to the oceans.</p>

<h3> Fish </h3>
<p style = 'text-align: justify'><strong>Fish  </strong> are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. 
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, 
lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes,
so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods
(i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner
the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic 
biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is
considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. </p>

<h3> Crabs </h3>
<p> Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting "tail" 
(abdomen) (Greek: βραχύς, translit. brachys = short,[2] οὐρά / οura = tail[3]), usually entirely hidden under the thorax.
They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and
have a single pair of claws. Many other animals with similar names – such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs,
horseshoe crabs, and crab lice – are not true crabs.</p>
<br>
<img src="../img/crab.jpg" id="fishes" alt="crab" title="Crab" />
<br><br>
<p>Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed 
primarily of highly mineralized chitin, and armed with a single pair of chelae (claws).
Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, while many crabs live in fresh water and on land,
particularly in tropical regions. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimetres wide,
to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span of up to 4 metres (13 ft).

About 850 species of crab are freshwater, terrestrial or semi-terrestrial species;[7] 
they are found throughout the world's tropical and semi-tropical regions. They were previously
thought to be a monophyletic group, but are now believed to represent at least two distinct lineages,
one in the Old World and one in the New World.

The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Jurassic,[9] although Carboniferous Imocaris,
known only from its carapace, may be a primitive crab.[10] The radiation of crabs in the Cretaceous
and afterward may be linked either to the break-up of Gondwana or to the concurrent radiation 
of bony fish, crabs' main predators.</p>

<h3> Dolphin </h3>
<br><br><img src="../img/dolphin.jpg" id="fishes" alt="dolphin" title="Dolphin" /><br><br>

<p>Dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the order Cetacea,
arbitrarily excluding whales and porpoises. The term dolphin usually refers to the extant families Delphinidae 
(the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), 
and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin).
There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.

Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5.6 ft) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10
t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females.
They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, 
some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. 
They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive 
even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber,
under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin,
prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals.
Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically
born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse
their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places like Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face
threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally
feature in literature and film, as in the film series Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks.
The most common dolphin species kept is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 captive killer whales. </p>
